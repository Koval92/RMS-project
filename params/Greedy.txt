# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Following params are:
#
# seed :                                    seed of the random
# nrOfThreads:                              nr of greedy threads
# nrOfNeighboursForStartingPoint            best nr of neighbours for the starting point
# sameStartingPoint                         should all greedy threads start from the same point
# nrOfPointsNeededToCheckArray              how many points are necessary to look into list, not into array,
#                                           for next closest point
# bestNrOfNeighbours                        what is the best nr of neighbours for the next point of path
# weightOfNeighbours                        coefficient describing importance of closest value of point's neighbours
#                                           rather than nearest distance
# weightOfDistance                          coefficient describing importance of closest distance rather than point with number
#                                           of neighbours closest to value of best number of neighbours
