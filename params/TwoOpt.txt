# params:
# isGreedy                              is algorithm greedy - swap vertex when he find first swap which will make route shorter,
#                                       or find best swap from all vertex
# maxNrOfIterations                     how many times algorithm should search better solution,
#                                       if -1 it will be searching till it finds no improvements
